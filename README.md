Codes generating the far-from-equilibrium process of descalarization in the paper arXiv: 2208.07548.

The file "generating initial data" generates the static solution, so-called hairy black hole, to the concerning system.

The data of hairy black hole is saved in "initial data" as an input to the file "simulation".

Files "function" and "simulation" simulate the dynamical process.

If use the codes please cite the papaer arXiv: 2208.07548.
